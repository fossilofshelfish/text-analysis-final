# YouTube Voices on AI Deepfakes
Abstract

This project applies computational text analysis methods to investigate public discourse surrounding AI deepfake technology on YouTube. Using the YouTube Data API v3, we collected 60 videos and their corresponding top comments, totaling 6,593 comments. Through sentiment analysis using NLTK's VADER, we found an overall slightly positive sentiment (mean = 0.028) with significant polarization between videos, ranging from -0.630 to 0.326. Word cloud analysis highlighted prominent themes of authenticity ("fake," "real") and misuse ("scam," "problem"), revealing public concerns about verification and technological risks. Topic modeling via NMF further identified three dominant discussion themes: practical methods for identifying deepfakes, mixed reactions to technological capabilities, and concerns about legal and societal consequences. Our analysis demonstrates that public opinion is not uniformly fearful but segmented by content type, with educational and detection-focused videos receiving more positive engagement than alarmist or tutorial content. These findings suggest that framing and practical utility significantly shape public reception of emerging AI technologies.
